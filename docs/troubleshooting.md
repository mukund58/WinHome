# Troubleshooting

This guide helps you diagnose and fix common issues with WinHome.

## Common config.yaml Parsing Errors

- **Indentation errors:** YAML is indentation-sensitive. Always use spaces, never tabs.
- **Missing quotes:** String values containing special characters should be wrapped in quotes.
- **Invalid values:** Ensure values match the expected type (e.g., `true`/`false` for booleans, numbers for dword values).

Example of a correct entry:
```yaml
systemSettings:
  darkMode: true
  showFileExtensions: true
```

If WinHome fails to parse your config, it will print the line number and reason. Double-check that line and the lines around it.

## Registry Permission Issues

WinHome modifies registry keys under `HKCU` (HKEY_CURRENT_USER). Common issues:

- **Running as SYSTEM:** WinHome's RegistryGuard actively blocks HKCU modifications when running as SYSTEM (e.g., in CI/CD pipelines or Scheduled Tasks) to prevent the Admin Context Trap. Always run WinHome as your actual user account, not as SYSTEM.
- **Access Denied:** Ensure WinHome is run with Administrator privileges. Right-click the EXE and select "Run as administrator".

## Network Failures During Bootstrapping

- **Winget not recognized:** Ensure the App Installer is updated from the Microsoft Store. WinHome attempts to use the system-level Winget automatically.
- **Download failures:** Check your internet connection. Corporate firewalls or proxies may block package manager endpoints.
- **Scoop/Chocolatey errors:** Ensure PowerShell execution policy allows scripts. Run the following in an administrative PowerShell window:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

## WSL Installation Problems

- **WSL not enabling:** Ensure virtualization is enabled in your BIOS/UEFI settings.
- **Distro not found:** Verify the distro name in your `config.yaml` matches exactly what is available via `wsl --list --online`.
- **Kernel version issues:** Run `wsl --update` manually to ensure your WSL kernel is up to date before running WinHome.

---

## Plugin Runtime Resolution Issues

WinHome sandboxes external plugins (Bun, Uv) with strict limits:
- **10MB max output buffer** — plugins producing excessive output will be terminated.
- **30-second timeout** — plugins that hang will be killed automatically.

If a plugin fails:
- Check that the plugin runtime (e.g., Bun, Uv) is installed and accessible in your PATH.
- Run WinHome with `--debug` to see the exact plugin command being executed and its output.

---

## Enabling Verbose/Debug Logging

Run WinHome with the `--debug` flag for detailed output:
```powershell
.\WinHome.exe --debug
```

This will print every action WinHome takes, including registry reads/writes, package manager calls, and plugin executions.

---

## How to Read Log Output

WinHome prints logs in this general format:
- **INFO** — Normal operations (e.g., installing a package, applying a registry key).
- **WARN** — Non-fatal issues that may need attention.
- **ERROR** — Something failed. Check the message for the affected resource and reason.

Progress is saved to `winhome.state.json` after every successful action. If WinHome crashes, the next run will resume from where it left off without duplicating completed actions.
